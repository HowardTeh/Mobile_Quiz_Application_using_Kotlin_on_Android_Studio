# Mobile_Quiz_Application_using_Kotlin_on_Android_Studio

Hello guys, first of all I would like to thank you for clicking on this project repository! I created this mobile quiz application while I am learning how to use Kotlin on Android Studio to create a mobile application.
This project is not an advanced or complex quiz application, however it enables users to use it and answer the quiz based on the pre-defined questions that I have set during
the development. 
At the end of the quiz, the app will tabulate the results and display the scores to the users.

Kindly have a good look on the project and let me know if you have a better way or solution to enhance this app. Thankyou.
